`@0no-co/graphql.web` is a utility library, aiming to provide the minimum of
functions that typical GraphQL clients need and would usually import from
`graphql`, e.g. a GraphQL query parser, printer, and visitor.

While its goal isn’t to be an exact match to [the GraphQL.js
API](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/graphql/) it aims to remain API- and
type-compatible where possible and necessary. However, its goal is to provide
the smallest implementation for common GraphQL utilities that are still either
spec-compliant or compatible with GraphQL.js’ implementation.

> **Note:** If you’re instead looking for a drop-in replacement for the
> `graphql` package that you can just alias into your web apps, read more about
> the [`graphql-web-lite` project](https://github.com/0no-co/graphql-web-lite),
> which uses this library to shim the `graphql` package.

[`@urql/core`](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql) depends on this package to
power its GraphQL query parsing and printing. **If you’re using `@urql/core@^4`
you’re already using this library! ✨**

### Overview

`@0no-co/graphql.web` aims to provide a minimal set of exports to implement
client-side GraphQL utilities, mostly including parsing, printing, and visiting
the GraphQL AST, and the `GraphQLError` class.

Currently, `graphql.web` compresses to under 4kB and doesn’t regress on
GraphQL.js’ performance when parsing, printing, or visiting the AST.

For all primary APIs we aim to hit 100% test coverage and match the output,
types, and API compatibility of GraphQL.js, including — as far as possible
— TypeScript type compatibility of the AST types with the currently stable
version of GraphQL.js.

### API

Currently, only a select few exports are provided — namely, the ones listed here
are used in `@urql/core`, and we expect them to be common in all client-side
GraphQL applications.

| Export | Description | Links |
| --- | ----------- | -------- |
| `parse` | A tiny (but compliant) GraphQL query language parser. | [Source](./src/parser.ts) |
| `print` | A (compliant) GraphQL query language printer. | [Source](./src/printer.ts) |
| `visit` | A recursive reimplementation of GraphQL.js’ visitor. | [Source](./src/printer.ts) |
| `Kind` | The GraphQL.js’ `Kind` enum, containing supported `ASTNode` kinds. | [Source](./src/kind.ts) |
| `GraphQLError` | `GraphQLError` stripped of source/location debugging. | [Source](./src/kind.ts) |
| `valueFromASTUntyped` | Coerces AST values into JS values. | [Source](./src/values.ts) |

The stated goals of any reimplementation are:
1. Not to implement any execution or type system parts of the GraphQL
   specification.
2. To adhere to GraphQL.js’ types and APIs as much as possible.
3. Not to implement or expose any rarely used APIs or properties of the
   GraphQL.js library.
4. To provide a minimal and maintainable subset of GraphQL.js utilities.

Therefore, while we can foresee implementing APIs that are entirely separate and
unrelated to the GraphQL.js library in the future, for now the stated goals are
designed to allow this library to be used by GraphQL clients, like
[`@urql/core`](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql).
